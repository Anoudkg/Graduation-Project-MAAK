IoT Based Remote Healthcare


The goal of this project is to present an IoT based healthcare monitoring system by 
collecting and processing IoT data to support medical services for patients with heart 
disease and reduce human exertion. The proposed model is applied by collecting and 
analyzing health data for the heart in real-time monitoring using body sensors and a 
microcontroller attached to a glove. This information will be saved in the application's 
database and work as a connecting point between the patient and the doctor. In case of any 
abnormality in the patientâ€™s heart status, the glove will alert nearby individuals to assist. 
With the help of this project, the time of patients and doctors is saved, and doctors can 
assist in emergency scenarios with limited number of hospitals, and where visits by patients 
are urgent
